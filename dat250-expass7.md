# <center> Dat250 lab 7 report

# <center> Isak Yau

In this lab, I encountered no issues. Everything went well because I used the Docker file
from the lecture notes as the base for how I created the application image.  
The image I created is for the newest version of my application including message broker and cache.  
There were some syntax issues I encountered, but I just had to spend a little time reading the documentation to understand it.  

There are no pending issues remaining for this lab.  
Everything that was a requirement has been implemented, only the optional ones have not been implemented.
